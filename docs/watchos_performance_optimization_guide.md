# watchOS SwiftUI Performance Optimization Guide

## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive strategies for optimizing watchOS SwiftUI applications to achieve <50ms UI updates, minimize memory usage (target: stay under 50KB for lookup tables, 50MB total app memory), and maximize battery efficiency. Based on 2024-2025 Apple best practices and developer experiences.

## Performance Targets

- **UI Updates**: <50ms for responsive interactions
- **Memory Usage**: 
  - Lookup tables: <50KB
  - Total app memory: <50MB (watchOS apps crash around 34MB in practice)
  - Widget memory: <30MB limit (strictly enforced)
- **Battery Efficiency**: Minimize CPU usage and background processing

## Instruments Tools and Profiling Checklist

### Essential Instruments (2024-2025 Updates)

#### 1. SwiftUI Instrument (New in Instruments 26)
**Purpose**: Dedicated SwiftUI performance analysis
**Key Metrics to Monitor**:
- [ ] **Update Groups**: Shows when SwiftUI is performing work
- [ ] **Long View Body Updates**: Identifies view body computations taking too long (>16ms)
- [ ] **Long Representable Updates**: Tracks UIViewRepresentable/UIViewControllerRepresentable bottlenecks
- [ ] **Unnecessary View Updates**: Detects views updating without visual changes
- [ ] **Cause & Effect Graph**: Visualizes update relationships and dependencies

**Color Coding**:
- Orange: Potential performance issues
- Red: Critical performance problems requiring immediate attention

#### 2. Time Profiler
**Purpose**: CPU usage analysis
**Checklist**:
- [ ] Enable "Hide System Libraries" to focus on app code
- [ ] Look for functions taking >10ms on main thread
- [ ] Identify recurring expensive operations
- [ ] Check for blocking operations on main thread

#### 3. Allocations Instrument
**Purpose**: Memory usage tracking
**Checklist**:
- [ ] Monitor Persistent Bytes (sorted descending by default)
- [ ] Track memory growth patterns
- [ ] Identify memory spikes during interactions
- [ ] Watch for objects not being deallocated

#### 4. Leaks Instrument
**Purpose**: Memory leak detection
**Checklist**:
- [ ] Run during typical user workflows
- [ ] Check for retain cycles
- [ ] Verify proper cleanup of timers and observers
- [ ] Test memory cleanup on view dismissal

#### 5. Hangs and Hitches
**Purpose**: Responsiveness monitoring
**Checklist**:
- [ ] Track main thread blocking >100ms
- [ ] Monitor animation smoothness
- [ ] Check scroll performance
- [ ] Identify UI freezes during user interactions

### Profiling Best Practices

#### Pre-Profiling Setup
- [ ] Profile on actual Apple Watch hardware (not Simulator)
- [ ] Test on older Apple Watch models (Series 4-6) for worst-case scenarios
- [ ] Use Release build configuration
- [ ] Clear watch storage and restart before profiling
- [ ] Test with low battery conditions

#### During Profiling
- [ ] Profile typical user workflows
- [ ] Test edge cases (large data sets, rapid interactions)
- [ ] Monitor during Digital Crown interactions
- [ ] Check performance during background transitions
- [ ] Test memory behavior with app backgrounding/foregrounding

#### Post-Profiling Analysis
- [ ] Focus on functions taking >16ms (60fps target)
- [ ] Identify patterns in memory allocation spikes
- [ ] Document performance regressions
- [ ] Create performance test scenarios

## Common watchOS Performance Bottlenecks

### 1. SwiftUI View Updates
**Issues**:
- Long view body computations
- Unnecessary view updates
- Complex view hierarchies

**Solutions**:
- Move expensive computations out of view bodies
- Use `@State` and `@Binding` efficiently
- Implement view caching for static content
- Optimize with `LazyVStack` and `LazyHStack`

### 2. NavigationLink Performance
**Issue**: NavigationLink renders destination immediately, increasing CPU usage
**Solutions**:
- Use lazy navigation when possible
- Implement custom navigation for complex flows
- Minimize destination view complexity
- Pre-load critical navigation destinations

### 3. Image Handling
**Issues**:
- Large image memory footprint
- Slow image loading
- Multiple image formats

**Solutions**:
- Use SF Symbols when possible
- Optimize image sizes for watch screen
- Implement image caching strategy
- Use WebP or HEIF formats for better compression

### 4. Memory Management
**Critical Limits**:
- watchOS apps crash around 34MB memory usage
- Widgets limited to 30MB
- Extensions have lower limits than main apps

**Solutions**:
- Implement lazy loading for data
- Use weak references appropriately
- Clear caches proactively
- Monitor memory during view transitions

## SwiftUI View Optimization Strategies

### 1. Efficient State Management
```swift
// ✅ Good: Minimal state updates
@State private var isLoading = false
@State private var displayValue = ""

// ❌ Avoid: Complex computed properties in body
var body: some View {
    Text(expensiveComputation()) // Don't do this
}
```

### 2. View Caching
```swift
// ✅ Good: Cache formatted values
@State private var cachedFormattedDate = ""

func updateCache() {
    cachedFormattedDate = formatter.string(from: date)
}
```

### 3. Lazy Loading
```swift
// ✅ Good: Use lazy containers for large lists
LazyVStack {
    ForEach(items) { item in
        ItemView(item: item)
    }
}
```

### 4. Identifiable Protocol Usage
```swift
// ✅ Good: Consistent identifiers for list performance
struct GameState: Identifiable {
    let id = UUID()
    // other properties
}
```

## Digital Crown Performance Best Practices

### 1. Modifier Order
```swift
// ✅ Correct order
Text("\(value)")
    .focusable(true)  // Must come BEFORE digitalCrownRotation
    .digitalCrownRotation($value, from: 0, through: 100, by: 1)
```

### 2. Sensitivity Configuration
```swift
// ✅ Optimize for use case
.digitalCrownRotation(
    $value,
    from: 0.0,
    through: 10.0,
    by: 0.1,
    sensitivity: .medium,  // .low, .medium, .high
    isContinuous: false,
    isHapticFeedbackEnabled: true
)
```

### 3. Integer Value Handling
```swift
// ✅ Good: Smooth integer stepping
@State private var crownValue: Double = 0
var integerValue: Int {
    Int(crownValue.rounded())
}
```

### 4. ScrollView Integration
**Issue**: Crown can only control one view at a time
**Solution**: Read crown value and manually control scroll offset

## Memory Optimization Strategies

### 1. Data Structure Optimization
- Use value types when possible
- Implement copy-on-write for large data structures
- Use lazy initialization for heavy objects
- Consider packed data structures for lookup tables

### 2. Cache Management
```swift
// ✅ Good: Bounded cache with cleanup
class BoundedCache<Key: Hashable, Value> {
    private let maxSize: Int = 50
    private var cache: [Key: Value] = [:]
    
    func cleanup() {
        if cache.count > maxSize {
            let keysToRemove = Array(cache.keys.prefix(cache.count - maxSize))
            keysToRemove.forEach { cache.removeValue(forKey: $0) }
        }
    }
}
```

### 3. Memory Monitoring
```swift
// Monitor memory usage in development
func logMemoryUsage() {
    let info = mach_task_basic_info()
    var count = mach_msg_type_number_t(MemoryLayout<mach_task_basic_info>.size)/4
    
    let kerr: kern_return_t = withUnsafeMutablePointer(to: &info) {
        $0.withMemoryRebound(to: integer_t.self, capacity: 1) {
            task_info(mach_task_self_, task_flavor_t(MACH_TASK_BASIC_INFO), $0, &count)
        }
    }
    
    if kerr == KERN_SUCCESS {
        let usedMB = Float(info.resident_size) / 1024.0 / 1024.0
        print("Memory usage: \(usedMB) MB")
    }
}
```

## Battery Efficiency Optimization
