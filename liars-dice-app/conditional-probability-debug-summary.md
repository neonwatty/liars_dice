# Conditional Probability Debug Summary

## Issue Reported
User reported seeing 72% probability instead of 100% when:
- Total dice: 10
- Bid count: 3 (from Screen 2)
- Bid face: 1 (ones, selected on Screen 3)  
- Player's hand: 3 dice all showing 1s

## Investigation Results

### 1. Mathematical Logic Verification ✅
- Created standalone test scripts that confirmed the conditional probability math is correct
- When player has 3 ones and bid is for 3 ones, the calculation correctly returns 100%

### 2. Debug Logging Added ✅
Added comprehensive logging to track the flow:

#### ConditionalProbabilityEngine.swift
```swift
print("=== ConditionalProbabilityEngine Debug ===")
print("Bid count: \(bid)")
print("Total dice: \(totalDice)")
print("Bid face: \(handConfig.bidFace)")
print("My matching dice: \(myMatchingDice)")
print("Remaining needed: \(remainingNeeded)")
```

#### HandConfiguration.swift
```swift
print("HandConfiguration: Set die at index \(index) to \(value ?? 0)")
print("HandConfiguration: Counting bid face \(bidFace), found \(count) matches")
```

#### HandEntryView.swift
```swift
print("HandEntryView: Updating bid face to \(Int(newValue))")
print("HandEntryView: Updating die at index \(selectedDieIndex) to \(value ?? 0)")
```

#### GameState.swift
```swift
print("GameState: Updating bid face from \(config.bidFace) to \(bidFace)")
print("GameState: updateConditionalProbability called")
```

### 3. Test Cases Created ✅
- ConditionalProbabilityDebugTests.swift - Tests the exact scenario
- ConditionalProbabilityUIFlowTest.swift - Simulates complete UI flow
- All tests pass when run in isolation

### 4. Build Status ✅
The app builds successfully with all debug logging in place.

## Next Steps for User

To diagnose the issue, the user should:

1. **Run the app in Xcode** with the console open
2. **Follow these exact steps**:
   - Screen 1: Set total dice to 10
   - Screen 2: Set bid to 3
   - Navigate to Screen 3
   - Set "My Dice" to 3
   - Verify bid face shows "1s" (ones)
   - Set all 3 dice to show 1
   - Check the probability display

3. **Look for these key log messages**:
   - "Bid face: 1" (confirms ones are selected)
   - "My matching dice: 3" (confirms all 3 dice are counted)
   - "Already have enough! Returning 100%" (confirms correct calculation)

## Possible Causes of 72% Display

If the user still sees 72%, check if:
1. The bid face might be set to a different value (not 1)
2. The dice values might not all be set to 1
3. There might be a UI refresh issue where the display doesn't update

The 72% value suggests the system might be calculating something different than expected, possibly:
- Wrong bid face selected
- Not all dice properly set to the same value
- A state synchronization issue

## Code is Ready
All debug logging is in place. The user just needs to run the app and check the console output to identify exactly what values are being used in the calculation.
